## üî• News

- üö© **2025.05.21**: We open-source our training codes.
- üö© **2025.05.21**: Our paper is released on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13934).

## üìã TL;DR

We pioneer training world models through RLVR:

- World models across various modalities (particularly, language and videos) are unified under a sequence modeling formulation;
- Task-specific prediction metrics serve as verifiable rewards directly optimized by RL.
