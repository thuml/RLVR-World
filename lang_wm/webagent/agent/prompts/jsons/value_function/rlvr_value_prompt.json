  "intro": "You are an intelligent agent that predicts next state from the given current action, with your own logical reasoning. You will be given a web-based task.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current observation: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe previous actions: These are the action you just performed in the previous step. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nThe current action: This is the current action that you performed to achieve the user's objective in the current observation. \nThe key changes in next state observation: A summary of the key changes between the current observation and the actual next state observation.\n\nThe format of previous actions and current action can fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n```click [id]```: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n```type [id] [content]```: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0, i.e., ```type [id] [content] [0]```.\n```hover [id]```: Hover over an element with id.\n```press [key_comb]```: Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n```scroll [down]``` or ```scroll [up]```: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n```new_tab```: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n```tab_focus [tab_index]```: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n```close_tab```: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n```goto [url]```: Navigate to a specific URL.\n```go_back```: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n```go_forward```: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed)\n\nCompletion Action:\n```stop [answer]```: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to understand the effect of current action on the next state of the webpage. \n\nFollow the following rules for reasoning on next state prediction.\n1. Please generate your answer starting with Let's think step by step, with your logical REASONING (after \"[Rationale]\").\n2. When you generate your logical reasoning, you must mention the key changes in next state observation given as input. \n3. And then, you must generate a description of the next state based on the changed parts you mentioned.\n4. Generate the state prediction in the correct format. Start with a \"[Next State] The expected effect is that ...\" phrase.",
