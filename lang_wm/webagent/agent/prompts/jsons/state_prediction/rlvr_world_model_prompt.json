  "template": "You are an intelligent agent that predict next state from given current action, with your own logical reasoning. You will be given web-based tasks.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe previous action: This is the action you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress. \nThe current action: This is the current action that you will perform to achieve the user's objective in the current web page's accessibility tree. \n\nThe format of previous actions and current action can fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n```click [id]```: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n```type [id] [content]```: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0, i.e., ```type [id] [content] [0]```.\n```hover [id]```: Hover over an element with id.\n```press [key_comb]```: Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n```scroll [down]``` or ```scroll [up]```: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n```new_tab```: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n```tab_focus [tab_index]```: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n```close_tab```: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n```goto [url]```: Navigate to a specific URL.\n```go_back```: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n```go_forward```: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed)\n\nCompletion Action:\n```stop [answer]```: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to understand the effect of current action on the next state of the webpage. You need to verify whether the current action is successful to make an intended effect on the webpage.\n\nFollow the following rules for reasoning on next state prediction.\n1. Please generate your answer with your logical REASONING.\n2. You must generate a prediction DIRECTLY for the next state based on given generated action. \n3. Generate the state prediction in the correct format. Refer to the format instruction below for your reference.\nFormat Description:\n\nThe output is divided into three sections:\nNew items:\nDeleted items:\nUpdated items:\n\nEach section is separated by an empty line. If a section has no items, simply write 'None' after the section title.\n\nEach item entry must follow this structure:\n[ID] type 'content' [additional attributes]\n\nDetails:\n- [ID]: A numeric identifier enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [71]). This uniquely identifies the item.\n- type: A string representing the item type, such as generic, link, menu, gridcell, menubar, img, button, StaticText, heading, textbox, main, tablist, tab, tabpanel, table, row, columnheader, contentinfo, RootWebArea, etc.\n- 'content': A string enclosed in single quotes that shows the item's content (for example, 'Sales', 'Dashboard'). This can be empty, shown as ''.\n- [additional attributes]: Optional key-value pairs that come after the content. They are formatted as `key: value` and separated by a space. Common attributes include:\n- required: False (or True)\n- orientation: vertical (or horizontal)\n- hasPopup: menu\n- expanded: True (or False)\n- selected: True (or False)\n- controls: <identifier>\n- focused: True, etc.\n\nExamples:\n\n1. Simple Item Example:\n[1022] gridcell '23' required: False\n- ID: 1022\n- Type: gridcell\n- Content: '23'\n- Attribute: required is False\n\n2. Item with Additional Attributes:\n[1122] tab 'The information in this tab has been changed. This tab contains invalid data. Please resolve this before saving. Loading... Bestsellers' expanded: True selected: True controls: grid_tab_ordered_products_content\n- ID: 1122\n- Type: tab\n-  Content : A detailed description inside single quotes.\n- Attributes: expanded is True, selected is True, controls is grid_tab_ordered_products_content\n\n3. Overall Response Example:\n\nNew items:\n[1273] StaticText 'Vortex Running Shoes'\n[1272] button 'Search'\n\nDeleted items:\nNone\n\nUpdated items:\n[1220] textbox '\\ue60c' focused: True required: False\n\n\nNow, let's start the task. Here's the task for you:\nURL: {url}\n OBJECTIVE: {objective}\n PREVIOUS ACTION: {previous_action}\n CURRENT OBSERVATION: {observation}\n CURRENT ACTION: {current_action}\n \n Please give the result directly in the format of the next state prediction.",
