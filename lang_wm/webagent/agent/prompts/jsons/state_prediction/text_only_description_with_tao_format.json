  "intro": "You are an intelligent agent that predict next state from given current action, with your own logical reasoning. You will be given web-based tasks.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe previous action: This is the action you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\nThe current action: This is the current action that you will perform to achieve the user's objective in the current web page's accessibility tree.\n\nThe format of previous actions and current action can fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n```click [id]```: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n```type [id] [content]```: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0, i.e., ```type [id] [content] [0]```.\n```hover [id]```: Hover over an element with id.\n```press [key_comb]```: Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n```scroll [down]``` or ```scroll [up]```: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n```new_tab```: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n```tab_focus [tab_index]```: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n```close_tab```: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n```goto [url]```: Navigate to a specific URL.\n```go_back```: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n```go_forward```: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed)\n\nCompletion Action:\n```stop [answer]```: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to understand the effect of current action on the next state of the webpage. You need to verify whether the current action is successful to make an intended effect on the webpage. If so, please explicitly mention the evidence, otherwise describe why it was not successful.\n\nFollow the following rules for reasoning on next state prediction.\n1. Please generate your answer starting with Let's think step by step, with your logical REASONING.\n2. When you generate your logical reasoning, you must identify and mention only the changed parts of the [accessibility tree] for the next state based on the given current action. \n3. And then, you must generate a description of the next state based on the changed parts you identified.\n4. Generate the state prediction in the correct format. Start with a \"[Next State] The expected effect is that ...\" phrase.",

      "[Rationale] \nLet’s think step by step. The current action involves clicking on the link for the “Carnegie Mellon Café” from the search results. This action is intended to access detailed information about the restaurant directly from the search results page. Consequently, the click leads to a transition where the webpage will display specific information about the “Carnegie Mellon Café,” including location details such as latitude and longitude. \n\nKey changes in the accessibility tree based on this action would include: \n1. The introduction of new nodes related to specific information about “Carnegie Mellon Café,” including headings for the node and tags. \n2. Display of geographic coordinates in the form of static text under a “Location:” section.\n3. Inclusion of detailed meta information related to the node, such as edit history and changeset information. \n\n[Next State]\nThe web page will transition to display detailed information about “Carnegie Mellon Café.” This includes:\n1. A RootWebArea with the title reflecting the café’s name along with its unique node identifier. \n2. Headings and static text elements providing detailed descriptions, including the exact latitude and longitude, which are shown under a location heading. \n3. Additional elements such as links to history, tags related to the restaurant, and other relevant OpenStreetMap functionalities (like downloading XML or viewing history). \nThese details are all presented to fulfill the objective of finding the latitude and longitude of the restaurant near CMU, thus completing the user’s task in this web-based interaction.\n"

      "[Rationale]\nLet’s think step by step. The current action is typing “HP Inkjet Fax Machine” into the search bar and executing the search by pressing the “Enter” key. This should trigger a search process that retrieves and displays relevant products matching or related to the query “HP Inkjet Fax Machine.” Therefore, the next state should reflect a search results page that shows listings for this specific product or similar products.\n\nKey changes in the accessibility tree based on this action would include: \n1. The RootWebArea will have a new title indicating it is now displaying results for the search query.\n2. A new heading will appear to denote the section for the search results specifically for “HP Inkjet Fax Machine.” \n3.Various product listings relevant to the search query will populate the area, including specific details like product names, prices, and related actions (e.g., add to cart).\n\n[Next State]\n1. The webpage will be updated to a new RootWebArea titled “Search results for: ‘HP Inkjet Fax Machine’,” focusing entirely on the search outcomes.\n2. A heading corresponding to the search term used will be prominent at the top.\n3. Product listings for the “HP Inkjet Fax Machine” and possibly related products will be displayed, including the prices and options for further actions like adding to cart or wish list. Each listing will provide specific information like the price and availability.\n4. Additional navigational and sorting options may be updated to reflect the search’s focus, facilitating user interaction with the listed products."
